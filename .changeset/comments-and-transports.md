Add comments & threaded replies, and a new `@plim/transports` package.

- **`@plim/transports`** (new): tiny, zero-dep duplex-channel primitives — the `Transport<T>` interface, in-memory loopback pair + broadcast bus, `BroadcastChannelTransport`, a reconnecting `WebSocketTransport`, and `mapTransport` codecs. The wire that collaboration and comments sync over.
- **`@plim/core`**: explicit `addMark` / `removeMark` transaction ops (alongside the existing `toggleMark`), with faithful inversion for undo. Needed for precise comment apply/remove.
- **`@plim/ledger`**: rebase + conflict handling extended to the new `addMark` / `removeMark` ops so comment highlights converge under concurrent edits.
- **`@plim/collaboration`**: Notion-style comments & replies. A comment is a `commentMark` in the document (so the highlight rides OT/collab and moves with the text); thread bodies live in an observable, last-writer-wins `CommentStore` synced over any `@plim/transports` channel via `CommentSync`. Ships default, overridable styling at `@plim/collaboration/comments.css`.
- **`@plim/react`**: drop-in `<CommentsLayer>` plus composable `CommentThreadCard` / `CommentCard` / `CommentComposer` / `useComments`. Register `commentMark` and mount the layer — the editor's selection toolbar gains a Comment button automatically; clicking a highlight opens its thread. The composer trigger is decoupled via `COMMENT_COMPOSE_EVENT` so any UI can drive it.
