# @plim/html

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Align all `@plim` package versions with a minor bump so every published package
  stays in lockstep at the same version, including the new `@plim/mojis` package.
- 94b47dd: Add three optional, non-breaking add-on packages:

  - **`@plim/html`** — a headless, SSR-safe serializer that renders a Plim document model to an HTML string (`serializeToHTML`) with overridable per-block / per-mark renderers and escaped-by-default output. No DOM, so it runs in Node, edge runtimes, email, and SEO pipelines.
  - **`@plim/storage`** — durable persistence primitives: pluggable `StorageAdapter`s (memory, `localStorage`, IndexedDB, and a `@plim/transports` server-document adapter) composed with debounced snapshot autosave (`createAutosave`).
  - **`@plim/test-utils`** — runner-agnostic testing helpers (fluent document/mark builders, a headless `createTestEditor` backed by the real driver, `applyTx`, and inspectors/assertions) for unit-testing custom blocks, marks, and extensions without a browser.

  These are additive primitives; no existing API changes. All `@plim/*` packages are bumped together to keep the suite on a single synchronized version.
